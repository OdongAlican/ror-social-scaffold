# Scaffold for social media app with Ruby on Rails

> In this project, we first drew an [ERD](https://app.lucidchart.com/documents/edit/22dc3271-90bb-4170-935b-4c4a55aa10bb/0_0) diagram, that represents associations amongst the models. We then created the friendrequest model which enables a user to add users, remove friends, accept or reject friend requests from other users. The project also has RSpec tests for the models and controllers as well as intergration tests.
